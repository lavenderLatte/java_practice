- Project Motivation:
	In Berkeley, CA there is a cakeshop called Crixa. They have amazing Tiramisu and Tres Leches cakes. Locals love to go there on Saturday morning to enjoy a cup of coffee with fine cake while reading a newspaper. When was thinking about how to design my final project for Objected Oriented Programming course, I thought of making the order management system of Crixa. This is just way of showing my appreciation how much I love their cakes. Crixa is not using management system and it's not mature enough to be used in actual situation.

- What It Can Do:
	• Casher can create an advanced cake order and link it with customer info 
	• Creating advanced order automatically generates Pick Up Call reminder task
	• Advanced order's status can be manually updated and this will also update Pick Up Call reminder status
	• Each order can be cancelled if necessary and Pick Up Call reminder task is also cancelled accordingly
	• Bakers in the kitchen can book oven schedule for each cake order
	• If time slot that baker reserved is over, that task will be marked as completed automatically
	• Anybody who use the system can see status of all the orders, all the tasks, all customer info
	• Debugging system with manipulated time is possible to check whether the system works appropriately when there is a time change such as start and end of summer time
